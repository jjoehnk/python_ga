The language was developed to emphasize readability of code (specifically, white-space use and syntax). \"The Zen of Python\" is a poem that explains the nature of the Python functionality:\n","\n","\n","#### _The Zen of Python_  \n","_Beautiful is better than ugly.  \n","Explicit is better than implicit.  \n","Simple is better than complex.  \n","Complex is better than complicated.  \n","Flat is better than nested.  \n","Sparse is better than dense.  \n","Readability counts.  \n","Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules. Although practicality beats purity.   \n","Errors should never pass silently.  \n","Unless explicitly silenced.  \n","In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.  \n","There should be one — and preferably only one — obvious way to do it. Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.\n","Now is better than never.  \n","Although never is often better than right now.  \n","If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.  \n","If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.   \n","Namespaces are one honking great idea — let's do more of those. _"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"ugJ4UwowCA1c"},"source":["---\n","\n","## Why Use Python for Data Analysis?\n","\n","##### General Purpose, Open Source, and Readability\n","\n","These are some of the more prominent reasons Python has been so widely adopted for data analysis.\n","\n","**General purpose:** Python was not intended to just be used for software or website development. Instead, it comes with the basic building blocks you need to develop anything you want with it.\n","\n","**Open source:** Going back to the \"basic building blocks\" point — a large open-source community has already created hundreds of libraries containing combinations of the foundation blocks to create more specific tool sets.
